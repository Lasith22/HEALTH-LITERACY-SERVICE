# Diabetes – home blood glucose testing for type 2 diabetes

## Also called finger prick test

### Key points about blood glucose testing at home for type 2 diabetes

- If you have type 2 diabetes, regular blood glucose testing at home using a blood glucose meter is generally not needed unless you are taking insulin or glipizide, gliclazide or glibenclamide.
- Home blood glucose testing is done with a blood glucose test meter. This is a finger prick test.

#### When is regular blood glucose testing at home recommended?

For people with type 2 diabetes, regular testing of blood glucose levels at home using a blood glucose test meter is generally not needed unless you are:

- starting or already taking [glipizide](/medicines-a-z/g/glipizide/ 'Glipizide')
  , [gliclazide](/medicines-a-z/g/gliclazide/ 'Gliclazide')
   or glibenclamide – this is because the risk of hypoglcaemia (low blood glucose) is higher with these medicines
- starting or already taking [insulin](/medicines/i/insulin-starting-for-type-2-diabetes/ 'Insulin – starting for type 2 diabetes')
- at risk of frequent episodes of [low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)](/health-a-z/l/low-blood-glucose/)
- planning a pregnancy or are pregnant.

#### What is the difference between home blood glucose testing and HbA1c levels?

**Home blood glucose testing:** This is done with a blood glucose test meter. It is a finger prick test where a sample of blood is placed on a test strip. This is inserted into the blood glucose meter, which gives you a reading of your blood glucose at a single moment in time.

**HbA1c test:** The HbA1c test measures the amount of glucose that has built up in your blood over a 3-month period. HbA1c testing is different from the glucose test (usually finger prick) that is used to tell you what your level is right now, due to things like smoking, exercise, medicines and what you eat. An HbA1c test is done to assess your blood glucose control over a longer 3-month period and to check how well your lifestyle measures such as diet and exercise, together with your diabetes medicines, are working to control your diabetes. An HbA1c test can't be done at home – instead a blood sample is sent to the laboratory. Read more about the [HbA1c test for type 2 diabetes.](/health-a-z/h/hba1c-test-monitoring-type-2-diabetes/ 'HbA1c test – monitoring type 2 diabetes')



#### What equipment do I need to test my blood glucose at home?

![undefined](https://healthify.nz/media/1002/blood-glucose-testing-2-300x212.jpg?width=228px&height=161px)

You will need:

- a blood glucose test meter
- lancets (prickers)
- a lancing device (a device, like a pen, to hold the pricker)
- blood glucose diagnostic test strips
- a notebook, diary or app to record your blood glucose levels.

In New Zealand a blood glucose test meter, together with lancets and diagnostic test strips, are only subsidised (funded) if you are taking insulin, glipizide, gliclazide, glibenclamide or if you have diabetes and are pregnant.

These criteria can change, so check with your diabetes nurse or doctor.

If you don’t qualify for a subsidised blood glucose meter, you can expect to pay between $50–70 to get fully set up with testing equipment. If you are buying or applying for a home testing meter, you will also need a finger-pricking device.

 about CareSens blood glucose meters.

#### How do I check my blood glucose?

If you are unsure about how to use your blood glucose meter, there are various healthcare providers who can teach you, such as:

- a diabetes nurse educator
- your local pharmacist
- the practice nurse at your GP surgery.

The following is a guide:

- Wash and dry your hands before testing.
- Insert a test strip into your meter.
- Use your lancet device to get a drop of blood from the side of your fingertip – to get a better-sized drop of blood, try warming your hands before testing.
- Touch and hold the edge of the test strip to the drop of blood and wait for the result.
- Your blood glucose reading will show up on the glucose meter display.

It's important to record your blood glucose level. Some blood glucose meters may record your blood glucose levels automatically or you can record your results in a [diabetes diary(external link)(external link)](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/downloads/blood-glucose-monitoring-diary/weekly-diary-without-doses.pdf 'Open external link')
 or in an app on your phone. Read about [diabetes apps.](/apps/d/diabetes-type-2-apps/ 'Diabetes apps')



You need to take your blood glucose record book or app to all appointments with your doctor, diabetes nurse educator or diabetes nurse specialist. They can check your blood glucose levels and decide on any medicine changes.

#### Wash your hands before testing

Washing your hands well before testing is essential, as dirt, contaminants or chemicals on your fingers can affect the reading. The preferred method is to wash your hands with soap, ensuring you rinse well with water to remove all soap residue, and then wipe them dry.

#### When should I test my blood glucose level?

If you have home blood glucose testing as part of your diabetes treatment plan, then you should always test if you have symptoms of [hypoglycemia](/health-a-z/l/low-blood-glucose/)
 (low blood glucose) or [hyperglycaemia](/health-a-z/h/hyperglycaemia/ 'Hyperglycaemia')
 (raised blood glucose). If you are feeling well, then how often you monitor your blood glucose level during the week can change, depending on your situation.

#### Taking glipizide, gliclazide or glibenclamide

When you first start glipizide, gliclazide or glibenclamide, you will need to test your blood glucose levels before meals and 2 hours after meals. Once your dose is stabilised, you can do less testing.

**Always test your blood glucose levels if you have symptoms of low blood glucose, such as feeling shaky, sweaty or suddenly unwell, suddenly feeling very hungry, feeling dizzy, or have a rapid change in behaviour or irritability. These are symptoms of hypoglycaemia.**

#### When you are unwell

It's also recommended that you check your blood glucose levels at least 3–4 times per day if you are feeling unwell. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you don’t have a plan. Read more about having a [diabetes sick day plan.](/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2-sick-day-plan/ 'Diabetes – sick day plan')

#### Other reasons for monitoring your blood glucose more often 

You will need to check your blood glucose more often if you:

- are pregnant
- take insulin, glipizide, gliclazide or glibenclamide and work in a hazardous job such as driving or operating machinery
- have a big change in your daily routine (eg, shift-work pattern, activity, food)
- have poorly controlled blood glucose levels – your healthcare team will advise you when to do this, so that your treatment can be adjusted.

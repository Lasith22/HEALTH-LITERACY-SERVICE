# Stroke | Mate rehu ohotata

### Key points about stroke

- A stroke (mate rehu ohotata) happens when the blood supply to your brain stops suddenly.
- It is a medical emergency and if you think you or someone else has had one, act fast.
- Think FAST to recognise the signs of a stroke: Face, Arm, Speech, Take action.
  - **F**ace: Is it drooping on one side?
  - **A**rm: Is one arm weak?
  - **S**peech: Is it mixed-up, slurred or lost?
  - **T**ake action: Call [111](tel:111)
     immediately.
- After a few minutes without oxygen and food from your blood, your brain begins to suffer damage.
- If treatment is started within a few hours, permanent damage can be avoided.

#### What are the symptoms of stroke? (+ VIDEO)

The signs and symptoms of stroke usually come on suddenly. The type of signs experienced will depend on what area of the brain is affected.

Common first signs of stroke include 1 or more of the following:

- **Face:** sudden drooping, weakness and/or numbness of face
- **Arm:** sudden weakness of the arm (and/or leg)
- **Speech:** difficulty speaking, words jumbled or lost voice.

**The T** in F.A.S.T. represents the need to take action – if you think somebody might be having a stroke, call 111 immediately.

These symptoms are present in 85% of strokes.

#### What is a stroke? (+ VIDEO)

Stroke refers to a sudden interruption of the blood supply to your brain, which can cause permanent damage. There are different types of stroke, described by the Stroke Foundation NZ as follows:

- **Ischaemic stroke:** This is the most common type of stroke. An ischaemic stroke occurs when a clot blocks an artery in the brain. Some strokes are caused when a clot forms in a small blood vessel inside the brain that has become narrowed through high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or smoking (lacunar stroke). Some strokes are caused when a clot forms outside the brain (eg, the carotid artery or the heart) then breaks off and travels in the bloodstream to block an artery to the brain itself (embolic stroke). A common cause for carotid artery clot is atherosclerosis (build up of cholesterol and calcium deposits). A clot in the heart can be caused by some heart conditions such as [atrial fibrillation.](/health-a-z/a/atrial-fibrillation/)
- **Embolic stroke:** This occurs when a blood clot or piece of plaque (cholesterol or calcium deposits) on the wall of an artery breaks loose and travels to the brain. When this happens, the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain is blocked and tissue is damaged or dies.
- **Haemorrhagic stroke:** This occurs when an artery in the brain ruptures (bursts) and leaks blood into the brain (cerebral haemorrhage). This break in the blood pipeline means parts of the brain are deprived of blood and a stroke occurs. Blood irritates brain tissue, causing swelling and pressure, which cause further damage and loss of function. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is when blood leaks into the surface of the brain. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is when there is bleeding into the brain tissue itself.

#### Who is at risk of having a stroke?

Each year about 9,000 people in New Zealand have a stroke. Strokes are more common as you get older, with 76% of strokes occurring in people over the age of 65 years. However, they can occur in younger adults and even children on rare occasions.

About 80% of strokes are preventable, so check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist as to what your risk is and what you can do to reduce it.

#### How is a stroke diagnosed?

To diagnose a stroke, ambulance and medical teams will ask you a series of questions. These will be about your symptoms, when they started, whether you have any other health conditions, etc. They will also use some standard assessment tools to help assess how urgently you need treatment.

If a stroke is suspected, further tests will be done, such as:

- [blood tests](/health-a-z/b/blood-tests/ 'Blood tests')
  to check your full blood count, electrolytes, renal function tests, fasting lipids, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein and glucose
- [electrocardiogram](/health-a-z/e/electrocardiograph-ecg/)
   to check your heart rhythm
- head [CT scan](/health-a-z/c/ct-scan/ 'CT scan')
- possibly additional investigations, eg, angiography, [chest x-ray,](/health-a-z/c/chest-x-ray/ 'Chest x-ray')
  syphilis serology, vasculitis screen, prothrombotic screen and Holter monitor.

These tests should be performed as soon as possible after a stroke. In some cases they may need to be performed as an emergency procedure.

#### What is the treatment for stroke?

The symptoms you have in the first few days after a stroke may not last forever. If your symptoms are going to improve, they usually do so in the first 2 months after you have a stroke. In many cases, if treatment is received early enough, full recovery is possible.

#### Early treatment is critical

Time is brain – meaning every minute counts and the longer brain cells are without oxygen, the more damage that is done. If treatment is started within a few hours, more brain cells can be saved.

Where possible, stroke patients are now treated within specialist stroke units. In most cases, treatment includes medication, rehabilitation and lifestyle changes.

#### In the acute phase:

- Medicine may be given intravenously to help dissolve blood clots (acute stroke thrombolysis).
- Sometimes surgery is needed to treat brain swelling or help reduce further bleeding in cases of haemorrhagic strokes.

#### In the recovery phase:

- Medication is given to lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels.
- Depending on the type of stroke and parts of the body affected, a range of rehabilitation support may be needed for weeks to months.
- Rehabilitation support can range from speech and language therapy to physical therapy and work retraining.
- Lifestyle changes are also needed as above to improve diet and exercise levels, support quitting smoking, managing stress and more.

#### How can I reduce my risk of stroke?

If you are at higher risk of having a stroke or have had one, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about what you can do to lower this risk.

Key steps include:

- lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as [high blood pressure](/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high/ 'Blood pressure – high')
  or [high cholesterol](/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high/ 'Cholesterol')
- quitting smoking and/or avoiding second-hand smoke
- keeping your weight at a healthy level or reducing it if you are overweight
- increasing [physical activity levels](/hauora-wellbeing/p/physical-activity/ 'Physical activity')
- reducing your salt intake
- reducing [stress](/health-a-z/s/stress/ 'Stress')
- managing any [anxiety](/health-a-z/a/anxiety/ 'Anxiety')
  or [depression.](/health-a-z/d/depression-overview/ 'Depression')

#### Fatigue after stroke

Fatigue (excessive tiredness) affects up to 92% of people who have had a stroke. It's normal to get tired after a busy day or not sleeping well the night before. This usually gets better after a good night's rest.

However, fatigue after stroke is an excessive tiredness that will not go away even after a good rest or sleep. You may feel constantly worn out, or have no energy to carry out usual daily activities.

#### Causes of fatigue after stroke

It is unclear why you get excessive tiredness after experiencing a stroke. It could be caused by a combination of factors, such as:

- brain damage due to stroke
- stress after having a stroke
- difficulty adjusting to your new life situation.

There are also a number of medical problems that could contribute to excessive tiredness after stroke. These include:

- diabetes
- anaemia
- insomnia
- sleep apnoea
- thyroid problems
- depression
- medications that have fatigue as a side effect
- poor diet.

**See your doctor if you have excessive tiredness after stroke so that they can check if you have any of these medical problems.**

#### Top tips to cope with fatigue after stroke

There are a number of things you can do to help cope with excessive tiredness after a stroke. These include to:

- exercise regularly
- eat well
- drink plenty of water
- sleep well
- avoid alcohol
- keep a diary on how much you are doing and discuss this with your doctor
- do regular activities in a day
- ask for help when you need it.

# Active Families programme

### Key points about the Active Families programme

- Active Families is a free programme.
- It is designed to help you and your children to get active and learn about healthy eating.
- Active Family coordinators help your family to set goals and get involved in programmes with fun, physical activities that children and parents can enjoy together. You will meet other families and get healthy eating advice.

#### Why is it important for children to be active?

Regular exercise helps children to maintain a healthy weight and build strong muscles and bones. It protects their hearts and can help their mental health. Active children are healthier, stronger, more confident, do better in school and sleep better.

#### What does the GRx Active Families programme involve?

Most regions have regular group activity sessions. These are held at community centres and may include:

- information and education about health, well-being and physical activity
- physical activity and healthy eating advice, goal setting and review
- cooking demonstrations, label reading and supermarket tours
- a physical activity session – this might include:
  - fitness circuits
  - modified games
  - sports
  - water-based activities.

Children work as a group on individual goals and achievements, and get to meet and have fun with other children and families who are part of the programme.

If group sessions are not available in your area, your family will still receive support through face-to-face meetings and home visits.

#### Who provides the GRx Active Families programme?

The GRx Active Families programmes are provided by community organisations.

#### What does GRx stand for?

GRx means a green prescription. A  green prescription
 is your health professional’s written advice to you to encourage you to become more physically active.

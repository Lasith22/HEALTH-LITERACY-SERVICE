# Active children

### Key points about active children

- Both children and adults need to be physically active and eat healthily to live well.
- Parents, family/whānau and caregivers, check out the tips and videos below and discover more about how to make sure your children exercise right so they can grow well.

#### How to encourage tamariki to be active

#### Get active daily

Daily physical exercise will keep your child healthy. Children should do a minimum of an hour of mild to intense physical activity every day. Try for plenty of mild exercises and some intense physical activities. This will help them to:

- Grow healthy, strong bones, muscles, and joints.
- Increase flexibility and balance.
- Grow and sustain healthy lungs and heart.
- Keep a healthy weight.
- Make friends and enjoy themselves.
- Develop good self-esteem.

#### Mild exercise

Children will be breathing more quickly and their heart rates will be a little bit faster. A good indicator of a mild level of exercise would be that your child can still talk with you whilst exercising. Try these suggestions:

- walking the dog
- bike ride in the park
- swimming in the pool
- playing on the playground
- dancing
- Kapa haka
- surfing, bodyboarding, or skim boarding at the beach
- skateboarding.

#### Harder exercise

Children will be puffed and their heart rates will be faster than during mild exercise (above).

A good indicator of a hard level of exercise would be that your child will only be able to say a couple of words to you and then will need to take a breath. Try these suggestions:

- running games such as bull rush or tag
- hiking
- swimming laps at the pool
- soccer, rugby
- playing touch rugby with friends, family/whanau
- Waka ama.

#### Encourage physical exercise

- Provide chances for your children to be physically active every day, with play, cultural events, dance, sports, creative games around the house, household chores, and when travelling (e.g. riding a bike to school, walking to a friends, scooting or skateboarding to the dairy).
- Try a range of activities to discover the ones that your child likes most. Encourage your child in every activity and offer positive feedback.
- Engage in physical activity as a family and let every family member have a turn in choosing an activity to try.

#### Turn technology off

Try to limit your child's ʻscreen timeʼ (TV, mobile phone, video games, movies) to under 2 hours a day. Try to inspire children to be active in a range of ways and as much as possible.

#### Be a role model

Your children look up to you, if you're physically active every day, this will most likely rub off on your children and make them more active too.

Choose a variety of healthy foods every day from the following 4 food groups:

- Vegetables and fruit
- Breads and cereals
- Milk and milk products
- Lean meats, chicken, seafood, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds.

#### Vegetables and fruit

Vegetables and fruit are packed with goodness. They provide carbohydrate, fibre, vitamins and minerals, and are low in fat.

You should aim to eat a range of different coloured vegetables and fruit, such as:

- red – capsicum, tomato, strawberry etc
- green – broccoli, beans, silverbeet, puha, peas, kiwifruit etc
- orange – carrot, mandarin, orange, pumpkin, golden kumara etc
- white – cauliflower, potato, pear, taro etc
- purple – eggplant, plum, red cabbage etc.

Depending on what age and stage you are at in your life, you will need different amounts of veggies and fruit each day. Read more about recommended serving sizes of vegetables and fruit for children and young people
and older people.

#### Breads and cereals

Breads, cereals and grains are a staple in many Kiwi diets. They include rice, pasta, breakfast cereals and other grain products. For younger people they are a good source of energy for busy lives, for growth, sport and fitness.

For heart health, choose wholegrain and high fibre varieties. Wholegrain varieties also help prevent constipation.

Depending on what age and stage you are at in your life, you will need different amounts of grain foods each day. Read more about recommended serving sizes for children and young people
and older people.

#### Milk and milk products

Milk is one of our staple foods in Aotearoa New Zealand. Drink it straight, add it to cereal, mix it into a smoothie, or use it for baking.

Milk products like milk, cheese and yoghurt provide energy, protein, vitamins and minerals including calcium. High-calcium foods help build strong bones. Choose low-fat milk and milk products for fewer calories and varieties with added calcium to support bone growth and density – particularly important for younger people who are growing and older people with poor bone density or osteoporosis.

If you are underweight or need extra energy, choose whole-milk products.

#### Lean meats, chicken, seafood, eggs, legumes seeds and nuts

This wide range of foods provides protein (which your body needs to grow), vitamins and minerals to your diet. Red meat, chicken and fish contain iron in a form that your body can easily absorb.

Oily fish is a good source of omega 3, which might reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Oily fish include tuna, kahawai, trevally, kingfish, warehou, dory, salmon, sardines, eel, squid, mussels and oysters.

Legumes, nuts and seeds are one of the most under-rated and healthy, affordable foods around. They can be eaten instead of meat or mixed into a dish and less meat used.  You can buy legumes dried or pre-cooked in a can for convenience.

#### Fats

Although fats are not a recommended food group as such, we all need some fat in our diet. It's a macronutrient needed for energy, building healthy cells, helping us to absorb some vitamins and antioxidants, and as a source of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids.

We can get enough fat from healthy food sources (eg, fish, avocado, nuts, olive oil) without needing to add extra fat from less healthy sources (eg, fried chips, fatty meat, cakes and pastries).

#### Vegetarians and vegans

A well-planned diet that avoids meat or other animal products can be healthy, but you need to make sure that your diet is meeting all your nutritional needs.

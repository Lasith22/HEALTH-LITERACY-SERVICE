#### 7 great reasons to exercise

#### 1\. Exercise can make you feel happier

It's true! Exercise can improve your mood and make you feel happier, by producing changes in the part of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. Exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help produce positive feelings. You don't even have to do anything strenuous to get these effects, even gentle exercise can lift your spirits.

#### 2\. Exercise can help you lose or control your weight

Exercise plays an important role in a healthy metabolism and helps you burn more calories per day. Regular exercise also plays a part in maintaining healthy muscles and bones, and assists with weight loss.

#### 3\. Exercise can reduce your risk of health conditions and disease

Lack of regular exercise is a contributor to many health conditions including [Type 2 diabetes](/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2/ 'Diabetes – type 2')
, [heart disease](/health-a-z/h/heart-disease/ 'Heart disease')
, [high cholesterol](/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high/ 'High cholesterol')
, [high blood pressure](/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high/)
and many [cancers](/health-a-z/c/cancer-topics/ 'Cancer')
.

#### 4\. Exercise can increase your energy levels

There are fantastic heart and lung health benefits when you exercise regularly. Aerobic exercise boosts the cardiovascular system, which can significantly help with energy levels.

#### 5\. Exercise helps you sleep better

Regular physical activity can help you sleep better and give you more energy during the day.

#### 6\. Exercise can help put the spark back into your sex life

Doing regular exercise can strengthen your heart, improve blood circulation, tone muscles, and enhance flexibility – all of which can improve your sex life. It can also decrease the risk of [erectile dysfunction](/health-a-z/e/erectile-dysfunction/ 'Erectile dysfunction')
in men.

#### 7\. Exercise can help your brain health and memory

Regular physical activity improves blood flow to the brain and helps brain health and memory. It can help protect mental function for older adults.

Best of all, exercise can be FUN and social! Physical activity is a great way to foster connection, meet up with whānau and friends, and share common interests. If you want some ideas for how to get active with your tamariki/kids and get them involved in a healthy, active lifestyle here are [some ideas.(external link)](https://www.healthykids.org.nz/move/articles 'Open external link')



#### How much exercise is needed to reduce risk?

The HealthEd NZ has published a useful table outlining [how exercise can help with various conditions and diseases.(external link)](https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/food-activity-and-sleep/physical-activity 'Open external link')
It also describes what type of exercise you should be concentrating on.

A moderate amount or level of exercise is beneficial for most people and it needn’t be hard to slot into your usual routine. The New Zealand guidelines for promoting physical activity define moderate-intensity activity as anything causing a slight but noticeable increase in breathing and heart rate. So get walking or swimming and you could be exercising your way to a long and, more importantly, healthy life.

If you're not used to physical activity, it can be tough to get going. This page has good information on [starting physical activity(external link)](https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/food-activity-and-sleep/physical-activity/being-active-everyone-every-age/starting-physical-activity-when-you-havent-been-active 'Open external link')

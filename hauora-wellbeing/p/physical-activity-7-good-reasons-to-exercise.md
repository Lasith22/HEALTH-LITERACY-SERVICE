#### How much exercise is needed to reduce risk?

The HealthEd NZ has published a useful table outlining how exercise can help with various conditions and diseases
It also describes what type of exercise you should be concentrating on.

A moderate amount or level of exercise is beneficial for most people and it needn’t be hard to slot into your usual routine. The New Zealand guidelines for promoting physical activity define moderate-intensity activity as anything causing a slight but noticeable increase in breathing and heart rate. So get walking or swimming and you could be exercising your way to a long and, more importantly, healthy life.

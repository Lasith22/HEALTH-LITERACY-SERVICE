# Carbohydrates

### Key points about carbohydrates

- Carbohydrates are an important source of energy in our diet.
- We often think of carbohydrate foods as bread, pasta, cakes, rice and potatoes but milk, other starchy vegetables and fruits also contain carbohydrates – even though they are part of other food groups.
- Some carbohydrates are better for us than others. Generally the less processed they are, the healthier they are.
- It's important to think about which ones to include as part of a balanced diet.

#### What are carbohydrates?

Carbohydrates are known as macronutrients and are 1 of the 3 major sources of energy in our diet, the others are protein and fat. Carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet.

There are 3 types of carbohydrates:

- **Sugar** is the simplest form and is found in table sugar, fruit, vegetables and milk products. It is also added to some processed foods, eg, biscuits, sugary drinks and sweets.
- **Starch** is a complex carbohydrate that's broken down and digested more slowly than simple sugars. It's found in vegetables and grains.
- **Fibre** is also a complex carbohydrate found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

#### Why do we need carbohydrates?

Carbohydrates are needed because they provide your body with energy. As they're digested, they're broken down into glucose which is absorbed into your bloodstream. It's then transported around the cells of your body. It can be used straight away to fuel your current activity and, if you have more glucose than you need, it's stored in your liver, muscles and cells so your body can use it later, or turned into fat.

#### Where are carbohydrates found?

Carbohydrates or 'carbs' are found in many foods and drinks. Some are found naturally (eg, as part of plants and grains) others are added when foods are processed (eg, when starch or sugar is added to cereals, tinned foods and sauces).

Examples of foods containing carbohydrates are:

- fruits
- starchy vegetables (eg, potato and kumara)
- breads
- nuts
- cereals
- rice
- pasta
- legumes (beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils)
- milk and milk products
- sugar.

#### How much do we need?

Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora nutrition guidelines say that carbohydrates should make up about half of our dietary intake. What's important though, is to think about the type and balance of carbohydrates (and other foods) we are eating.

Some carbohydrates are better for you to eat on a regular basis than others as they are less processed and contain more nutrients. Read more about [some healthy carbohydrate-rich foods and how to use them.(external link)](https://www.hri.org.nz/health/nutrition/5-healthy-carbohydrate-rich-foods 'Open external link')

A carbohydrate portion size is about the size of your closed fist – which means that a portion size for a child is different to a portion size for an adult, and a portion size for a small adult is different to that of a large adult.

A general rule when thinking about how to fill your plate is to divide it into quarters and have about a quarter of it filled with starchy vegetables (eg, potato, taro, taewa, corn) and grain foods (eg, rice, pasta, bread).

When deciding what types of carbohydrate to have here are some guidelines:

- **Eat the most of whole, unprocessed, non-starchy vegetables:** Lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, cucumber, broccoli.
- **Eat some of whole, partly processed carbohydrates:** Intact grains, whole grain bread, corn, green peas, kumara, pumpkin, lentils, chickpeas, apples, strawberries, blueberries.
- **Try to limit or avoid very processed foods:** Sugary drinks, processed grains (eg, white bread), white rice, sugary cereals, cakes, biscuits, sweets.

.

#### Carbohydrates and the glycaemic index

All carbohydrates are broken down in the gut to release glucose, which is our main fuel supply. The rate of breakdown is measured by a system called the glycaemic index (GI), which ranks food on a scale from 0 to 100 according to the effect it has on blood glucose levels. Foods with an index number of 70 or more are considered to be high GI (foods that break down quickly), foods with an index number between 56 and 69 are considered to be medium GI, and foods with an index number of 55 or less are low GI (foods that break down slowly).

#### Examples of low GI foods

- Wholegrain bread.
- Chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils.
- Milk, yoghurt.
- Apples, pears, grapes, kiwifruit.
- Pasta, noodles, basmati rice.
- Oats, bran.

#### Examples of high GI foods

- White and some wholemeal breads.
- Rice cakes.
- Honey.
- Watermelon.
- Short-grain white rice.
- Puffed wheat, cornflake and rice flake cereals.

If you have diabetes knowing about the glycaemic index of different foods can help you manage your blood glucose levels. Read more about the [glycaemic index](/hauora-wellbeing/g/glycaemic-index-gi/)
and, if you would like to find out the GI of a particular food you can look it up on the database at [www.glycemicindex.com.(external link)](http://www.glycemicindex.com/ 'Open external link')

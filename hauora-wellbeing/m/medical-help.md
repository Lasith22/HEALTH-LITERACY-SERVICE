# Medical help

## Where to go when you need health care in Aotearoa New Zealand

### Key points about getting medical help

- There's a wide range of health services in Aotearoa New Zealand.
- When you or your whānau get sick, it's important to think about whether you really need to ask for medical help or if you can manage your symptoms at home.
- Our health system is under pressure and some medical centres are not taking new patients.
- The information below will guide you on what to do for yourself and then who to contact if you decide you need help.

#### Where to go for health care

#### Look after yourself at home

For most minor illnesses and conditions there are lots of things you can do to manage your symptoms at home. Make sure you have a few basics, eg, pain killers, plasters and antiseptic cream on hand.

Here's a list of [common illnesses and symptoms you might be experiencing](/health-a-z/c/common-symptoms-and-what-to-do/)
and what to do.

Remember to test for COVID-19 if you a fever (high temperature), cough, runny nose, sore throat or breathing problems. If you test positive, read more about [what to do next](/health-a-z/c/covid-19-positive-what-do-i-do-now/ 'COVID-19 positive – what do I do now?')
.

Otherwise, we have information to guide you on how to look after yourself before asking for help. See our:

- [Winter infection topics](/health-a-z/w/winter-infections/)
  for information about the different seasonal illnesses going round.
- [Winter wellbeing topics](/hauora-wellbeing/w/winter-wellbeing-topics/)
  to help you and your whānau keep warm and well.
- [Health A–Z](/health-a-z/)
   section for information about specific health conditions
- [Medicines](/medicines-a-z/)
   section for advice about medicines
- [Hauora Wellbeing](/hauora-wellbeing/)
   section for tips on exercise, mental health, managing long-term conditions and much more.

We also have a wide selection of videos on pages and a growing [app library](/apps/)
of apps reviewed by Healthify.

#### Get advice or medicines from your local pharmacy

Your local pharmacy provides free on-the-spot advice about medicines and health concerns like coughs, colds and [vaccinations](/health-a-z/i/immunisation-who-can-give-vaccinations-and-where-can-i-find-them/)
. They also provide specific services, eg, treatment for urinary tract infections, blood glucose and blood pressure checks. Some pharmacies are open late and open 7 days a week. Read more about [what pharmacists do](/hauora-wellbeing/p/pharmacist/)
 or [find a pharmacy near you.(external link)](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/pharmacy/ 'Open external link')

#### Call Healthline for advice

- If you can’t access a GP or don’t have one, you can call Healthline for free on [0800 611 116](tel:0800611116)
  for trusted health advice, treatment, and information about what to do next.
- Healthline nurses, paramedics and advisors are available anytime, day or night.
- Doctors (who can help with prescriptions) are available 7am to 11pm.
- You can choose to speak with a Māori clinician if you’re calling between 8am and 8pm.
- When you call, you can use your mobile to share images and video – to help the team help you.
- Interpreters available. The Healthline team can arrange to talk to you in your language. When your call is answered, say you’d like an interpreter and the language you’d like to speak in.
- If you need assistance, you can access Healthline using the NZ Relay Service [nzrelay.co.nz(external link)](http://www.nzrelay.co.nz/ 'Open external link')
  .

####

You can call Healthline or… Healthline can call you

- Anyone can call Healthline for free health advice, treatment, and information, anytime on [0800 611 116](tel:0800611116)
  .
- If you don’t need help or advice straight away, rather than calling Healthline, you can ask them to call you.
- This is also a great option if you’re busy, or if Healthline is.
- To do that, go to [www.healthy.org.nz(external link)](http://www.healthy.org.nz/ 'Open external link')
  , click ‘request a call back’, enter a few details, and a Healthline nurse or paramedic will call you back.

#### Contact your general practice team or Sexual Wellbeing Aotearoa clinic

Studies show we all do better when we enrol with a primary care provider (eg, a general practice team or nurse-led clinic) and have regular checks. Turning up with a long list of problems or only when you're really sick doesn't build the trusted relationship you need.

If you haven’t done so already, register with a doctor or nurse practitioner in your area, so you can have your own healthcare team. Other advantages of enrolling with a clinic are:

- Lower cost care (and sometimes free care for high need areas).
- Repeat scripts and phone or email advice.
- The option of video and phone consults with a team who know you. Read more about [telehealth](/health-a-z/t/telehealth-faqs/)
  .

**Note:** our healthcare system in Aotearoa New Zealand is under pressure and some medical centres and clinics are not accepting new patients. Visit [this link on the Healthpoint website(external link)](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/gps-accident-urgent-medical-care/?options=openBooks 'Link to GP clinics enrolling patients on Healthpoint')
and enter your address to find a medical centre near you that's accepting enrolments.

If you want help or advice on contraception, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or any sexual health queries, contact your local [Sexual Wellbeing Aotearoa(external link)](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/search?q=Sexual%20Wellbeing%20Aotearoa 'Open external link')
clinic. Visits are free for New Zealand citizens or residents.

#### When it's urgent, your general practice is closed, but it's not an emergency

If your family doctor is not available there are 2 main options. One is an online consultation (also known as [telehealth](/health-a-z/t/telehealth-faqs/)
 or virtual consultation), and the other is an in-person consultation at your local Urgent Care Clinic (Accident and Medical), or after-hours clinic.

#### Urgent care and after-hours clinics

These clinics can provide urgent care for injuries or illnesses when you need to be seen in person or are likely to need an examination.  [Find an Urgent Care Clinic(external link)](https://www.adhb.health.nz/your-health/find-an-accident-and-medical-clinic/ 'Open external link')
 online or call your general practice who will have a recorded message or somebody to advise on what to do.

To learn more about the fees charged by a particular clinic, visit their page on [Healthpoint.(external link)](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/gps-accident-urgent-medical-care/ 'Open external link')

#### Telehealth or virtual consultation apps

An increasing number of conditions can be assessed and treated through a telehealth consultation with a doctor, nurse, psychologist or other healthcare provider. This can be done through your phone or computer. [Read more about the available options for virtual consultations.](/health-a-z/t/telehealth/)

**Ka Ora Telecare**

An after-hours telehealth service is available to people living in, or visiting, rural communities in Aotearoa New Zealand. It's available 5pm to 8am weekdays and round the clock on weekends and public holidays. Phone or video consultations are available and can be booked through the [Ka Ora Telecare website(external link)](https://kaora.co.nz/app/ 'Link to Ka Ora Telecare website')
or by calling 0800 2 KA ORA (0800 252 672). A cost may be involved and you will be informed about this when you contact the service. Read more about the [Ka Ora Telecare service(external link)](https://kaora.co.nz/app/ 'Link to Ka Ora telehealth service')
.

#### When it's an emergency

If it's an emergency, dial 111 (free) or go directly to your closest emergency department. Emergencies include anything that is life threatening, such as difficulty breathing, chest pains or uncontrolled bleeding, or when you have severe pain or other trauma. [Find an emergency department.(external link)](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/emergency/ 'Open external link')



Treatment at the hospital is free, but if you go in an ambulance you will probably be charged for it. If you need one often it's a good idea to get a [St John subscription.(external link)](https://www.stjohn.org.nz/globalassets/documents/support_us/supporters_scheme_membership_form.pdf 'Open external link')

You can call Healthline or… Healthline can call you

- Anyone can call Healthline for free health advice, treatment, and information, anytime on 0800 611 116
  .
- If you don’t need help or advice straight away, rather than calling Healthline, you can ask them to call you.
- This is also a great option if you’re busy, or if Healthline is.
- To do that, go to www.healthy.org.nz
  , click ‘request a call back’, enter a few details, and a Healthline nurse or paramedic will call you back.

#### Contact your general practice team or Sexual Wellbeing Aotearoa clinic

Studies show we all do better when we enrol with a primary care provider (eg, a general practice team or nurse-led clinic) and have regular checks. Turning up with a long list of problems or only when you're really sick doesn't build the trusted relationship you need.

If you haven’t done so already, register with a doctor or nurse practitioner in your area, so you can have your own healthcare team. Other advantages of enrolling with a clinic are:

- Lower cost care (and sometimes free care for high need areas).
- Repeat scripts and phone or email advice.
- The option of video and phone consults with a team who know you. Read more about  telehealth

If you want help or advice on contraception, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or any sexual health queries, contact your local Sexual Wellbeing Aotearoa
clinic. Visits are free for New Zealand citizens or residents.

#### When it's urgent, your general practice is closed, but it's not an emergency

If your family doctor is not available there are 2 main options. One is an online consultation (also known as  telehealth
 or virtual consultation), and the other is an in-person consultation at your local Urgent Care Clinic (Accident and Medical), or after-hours clinic.

#### Urgent care and after-hours clinics

These clinics can provide urgent care for injuries or illnesses when you need to be seen in person or are likely to need an examination.  
 online or call your general practice who will have a recorded message or somebody to advise on what to do.

#### Telehealth or virtual consultation apps

An increasing number of conditions can be assessed and treated through a telehealth consultation with a doctor, nurse, psychologist or other healthcare provider. This can be done through your phone or computer.

**Ka Ora Telecare**

An after-hours telehealth service is available to people living in, or visiting, rural communities in Aotearoa New Zealand. It's available 5pm to 8am weekdays and round the clock on weekends and public holidays. Phone or video consultations are available and can be booked through the Ka Ora Telecare website
or by calling 0800 2 KA ORA (0800 252 672). A cost may be involved and you will be informed about this when you contact the service. Read more about the Ka Ora Telecare service
.

#### When it's an emergency

If it's an emergency, dial 111 (free) or go directly to your closest emergency department. Emergencies include anything that is life threatening, such as difficulty breathing, chest pains or uncontrolled bleeding, or when you have severe pain or other trauma.  Find an emergency department.

Treatment at the hospital is free, but if you go in an ambulance you will probably be charged for it. If you need one often it's a good idea to get a  St John subscription.

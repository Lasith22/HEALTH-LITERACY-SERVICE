#### What is Galvus?

Galvus (Vildagliptin) is a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It may be used by itself, or it may be combined with other diabetes medication such as metformin (see Galvumet
).

Galvus works by increasing the amount of insulin produced by your body and reducing the amount of glucagon produced by your pancreas. Glucagon causes your liver to produce more glucose, so by reducing the amount of glucagon in your body, this also helps to reduce the levels of glucose in your blood.

#### Dose

In Aotearoa New Zealand Galvus is available as tablets (50 mg).

- The usual dose of Galvus is 1 tablet once a day or twice a day.
- Always take your Galvus exactly as your doctor has told you. The pharmacy label on your medicine will tell you how much to take, how often to take it, and any special instructions.

#### How to take Galvus

- **Take Galvus once or twice a day.** Galvus is usually taken once a day, in the morning. If you have been told to take 2 doses each day, take your first dose in the morning and the second dose in the evening. Take your medicine at about the same time each day.
- **Swallow your tablets whole, with a drink of water**. You can take the Galvus with or without food. If you have problems swallowing Galvus tablets, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
- **Missed dose**: If you forget your dose, take it as soon as you remember that day. But, if it is nearly time for your next dose, just take the next dose at the right time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.
- **Keep taking Galvus regularly.** To control your diabetes, you must keep taking Galvus every day. Do not stop taking Galvus suddenly, speak to your doctor or nurse before stopping.

#### What to know while you are taking Galvus

Here are some things to know when you're taking Galvus. Other things may be important as well, so ask your healthcare provider what you should know about.

- **Limit alcohol while taking Galvus.** Having the occasional drink while you are taking Galvus is safe. However, regularly drinking excessive amounts increase your chance of side effects and reduce the effects of Galvus.
- **Galvus and other medicines or supplements:** Galvus can interact with some medications, herbal supplements and rongoā Māori, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Galvus and before starting any new products.

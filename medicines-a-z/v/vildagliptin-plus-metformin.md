#### What is Galvumet?

Galvumet is a combination of two medicines, vildagliptin and metformin, in a single tablet. \*\*Note: vildagliptin on its own is called Galvus.

Galvumet is used to treat type 2 diabetes. Galvumet helps to control blood glucose levels by making your pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon (effect of vildagliptin) and also by helping your body to make better use of the insulin it produces (effect of metformin).

#### Dose

In Aotearoa New Zealand Galvumet is available as tablets in 2 strengths – Galvumet 50/850 mg and Galvumet 50/1000 mg.

- Check with your doctor or pharmacist which strength you are taking.
- The usual dose of Galvumet is 1 tablet twice a day.
- Always take your Galvumet exactly as your doctor has told you. The pharmacy label on your medicine will tell you how much to take, how often to take it, and any special instructions.

#### How to take Galvumet

- **Take Galvumet twice a day, in the morning and the evening.** It is best to take Galvumet with food. Swallow your tablets whole with a glass of water (200–250 mLs).

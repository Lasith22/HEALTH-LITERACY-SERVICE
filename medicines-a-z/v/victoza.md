#### What is Victoza?

Victoza is used to treat type 2 diabetes and to protect you from having a heart attack or stroke. Victoza also protects your kidneys and may help you to live longer. Read more about [type 2 diabetes.](/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2-overview/)

- Victoza lowers your blood glucose in several ways, including by helping your pancreas produce more insulin after meals, slowing down how quickly food is absorbed and reducing your appetite.
- This is one reason people on Victoza usually lose weight.
- Victoza can be used alone or with other diabetes medicines (such as metformin or insulin), along with healthy eating and regular exercise.
- Victoza is available as an injection given under your skin.

#### Is Victoza the same as insulin?

Although Victoza is an injection, it is NOT insulin.

- Victoza helps your body to release its own insulin just when you need it, improving blood glucose control throughout the day.
- Unlike insulin it won't cause weight gain or low blood glucose levels ([hypoglycaemia](/health-a-z/l/low-blood-glucose/)
  ) when used alone.

#### Dose

Always use Victoza exactly as your doctor has told you. The pharmacy label on your medicine will tell you how much to use, how often to take it and any special instructions.

- The starting dose is **0.6 mg** once a day, for at least one week.
- Your doctor will tell you when to increase it to **1.2 mg** once a day.
- Your doctor may tell you to further increase the dose to **1.8 mg** once a day, if your blood glucose is not adequately controlled with a dose of 1.2 mg per day.

Don't change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

#### How to use Victoza

#### Victoza comes as a pen injection

Victoza comes as a ready-to-use injection pen, which is pre-filled with the medicine. One pen has 30 doses of 0.6 mg, 15 doses of 1.2 mg or 10 doses of 1.8 mg.

The Victoza pen has a dose selector that makes it easy for you to select your dose. If you selected a wrong dose by mistake, you can change it by turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until the right dose lines up with the pointer.

#### Use Victoza once a day

You can have your dose at any time of the day, with or without food. When you have found the most convenient time of the day, it's best to inject Victoza around the same time of the day.

#### Victoza pens are not pre-fitted with needles

A suitably sized needle has to be attached to the pen. Your pharmacist will advise you on which needles are funded. Always use a new needle for each injection.

#### Change (rotate) your injection site each day

The best places to give yourself the injection are the front of your thighs, abdomen (tummy), or your upper arm.

Change (rotate) your injection site each day. You can use the same area of your body, but be sure to choose a different injection site in that area. Don't inject into skin that is sore, bruised, red, hard, scarred or skin that has stretch marks or psoriasis plaques.

#### If you forget your dose of Victoza

If you forget a dose, use Victoza as soon as you remember. However, if it's more than 12 hours since you should have used Victoza, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose as usual the following day. Don't take an extra dose or increase the dose on the following day to make up for the missed dose.

#### If you're unwell

Most people tend to have raised blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) when they're unwell, so it's important to continue taking your diabetes medicine.  Victoza usually doesn't cause problems if you are slightly unwell. If you're dehydrated, with vomiting (being sick) and diarrhoea (runny poo) and not eating and drinking as usual, you may need to stop your injections until you feel better. Let your healthcare provider know if this happens so they can advise on whether you need to stop, and when to re-start.

#### Things to consider before taking Victoza

**Pregnancy and contraception**

If you're pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice as Victoza is not currently recommended during pregnancy.

Research has found that Victoza may increase the likelihood of some women returning to normal ovulation. If you're sexually active and don't want to become pregnant, you should use effective means of contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancy. Read more about [contraception](/health-a-z/c/contraception/)
.

#### How to store Victoza

**Before opening**  
Store Victoza in the fridge, in the original package. Do not freeze. If your pen has been frozen, do not use it.

**During use**  
You can keep the pen for 1 month when stored at room temperature (below 30°C) or in a refrigerator (2°C– 8°C). Don't freeze it.

When you're not using the pen, keep the pen cap on in order to protect from light.

#### Get rid of your used needles safely

It's important to get rid of your used needles safely. Keep them out of reach of children and pets, and places where they could hurt others. You can do this by buying a sharps container from your pharmacy. This is a special container made of hard plastic that has a tight-fitting lid so used needles and syringes can be stored securely.

Don't flush used needles down the toilet or put them in household or public rubbish or recycle bins. Once your sharps container is full, take it to your pharmacy for safe disposal.

#### What are the side effects of Victoza?

Like all medicines, Victoza can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.

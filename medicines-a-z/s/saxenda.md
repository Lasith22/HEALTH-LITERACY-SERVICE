#### What is Saxenda?

Saxenda is a weight-loss treatment that is used together with a healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise as part of an overall weight-loss plan. It is recommended for adults with excess weight (a BMI of 27 or more) who also have weight-related medical problems or those with a BMI of 30 or more (obese). The use of weight loss medicines depends on your body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated using your height and weight.

Saxenda suppresses your appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and reducing feelings of hunger, which can lead to eating fewer calories and losing weight.

In Aotearoa New Zealand Saxenda comes as an injection that it is given under your skin, and is available on prescription only.

#### Dose of Saxenda

- The usual starting dose is 0.6 mg once a day.
- Your doctor will tell you how long to keep taking this dose. It will be for at least 1 week.
- Your dose may then be increased by 0.6 mg each week until you reach the recommended dose of 3 mg once a day.
- Once you reach the recommended dose of 3 mg in week 5 of treatment, keep using this dose until your treatment period ends. Do not increase your dose further.

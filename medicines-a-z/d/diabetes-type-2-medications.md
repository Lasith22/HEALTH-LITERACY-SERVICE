#### When are medicines used for type 2 diabetes?

When you have type 2 diabetes (mate huka), your body does not make enough insulin or does not use it well enough. This leads to raised blood glucose (sugar) levels. Having constantly raised blood glucose levels damages your blood vessels and nerves, leading to problems affecting your kidneys, feet and eyes. Your risk of stroke and heart attacks also increases.

When used with a healthy diet and exercise, diabetes medicine can effectively lower your blood glucose levels.

Diabetes medicines are used to lower blood glucose levels when lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise have not been successful. Sometimes medicines are prescribed at first diagnosis if blood glucose levels are very high. You need to keep eating a healthy balanced diet, managing your weight and exercising regularly even when you are taking diabetes medicines.

#### Examples of diabetes medicines

There are a variety of medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes – most are available as tablets. The most commonly prescribed medicine is metformin. Some people also need insulin, which is available as an injection only.  
Your diabetes may be well controlled on one medicine alone, or you may need a combination of medicines. Some people need a combination of tablets and insulin injection. Every person’s care plan is different and your healthcare provider will work with you to find out the best treatment plan for you.

#### What are the considerations when choosing medicines for type 2 diabetes?

Here are some of the things you and your doctor may consider when deciding on the best treatment for you.

**Your blood glucose levels:** Most people with type 2 diabetes are started on metformin tablets. If you are unable to take metformin because of side effects or other reasons, your doctor will consider starting you on other medicines. If your blood glucose level is not successfully lowered with metformin alone, your doctor may add in other medicines that act in different ways to lower your blood glucose levels.

**Other health conditions:** Some conditions you might have along with diabetes can affect how well your medicines control your blood glucose, including:

- obesity
- high blood pressure
- high cholesterol
- heart disease
- kidney disease.

**Funding:** Some newer diabetes medicines such as empagliflozin and vildagliptin are funded for people with diabetes if they meet certain criteria (also called a special authority).
.

**Side effects:** When deciding on the best medicine for you, discuss with your healthcare provider the possible side effects of the medicine and how these are likely to affect you or your lifestyle, such as weight gain or the risk of  hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
.

#### What is Jardiamet? (+ VIDEOS)

Jardiamet is used to treat type 2 diabetes and protect your kidneys and heart. It's a combination of 2 medicines, empagliflozin and metformin, in a single tablet.
.

Jardiamet lowers your blood glucose and blood pressure by helping your kidneys get rid of glucose, salt and fluid when you pass urine (pee/mimi). Jardiamet has other benefits such as weight loss, helping your kidneys work better and lowering your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. It may also help you to live longer. Jardiamet is best used together with healthy eating and regular exercise.

**Note:** Empagliflozin on its own is called Jardiance.

#### How to take Jardiamet

- **Timing:** Take Jardiamet 2 times a day – in the morning and the evening. Jardiamet is best taken with or just after food or a meal, to lessen the chance of stomach upset.
- **Drink enough water so you don't get thirsty:** When you start taking Jardiamet, you may pee more but this gets better over a few weeks. If you’ve been told to limit how much you drink, talk to your healthcare team.
- **Avoid or limit alcohol while you are taking Jardiamet:** It may affect your blood glucose control and increase your risk of side effects. Drinking alcohol very often or drinking a lot of alcohol over a short time (binge drinking) can affect your diabetes and lead to high ketone levels. This can cause a serious but rare side effect called ketoacidosis
  .
- **Missed dose:** If you forget your dose, take it as soon as you remember that day. But if it's nearly time for your next dose, just take the next dose at the usual time. Don't take double the dose.
- **Don't run out of tablets:** Jardiamet works best when taken every day. See your healthcare team every 3 months for a new prescription.

#### What to know while you are taking Jardiamet

Here are some things to know when you're taking Jardiamet. Other things may be important as well, so ask your healthcare provider what you should know about.

#### Have a sick day plan

If you are unwell, stop taking Jardiamet. Taking Jardiamet when you are unwell increases your risk of high ketones levels, which can cause a serious but rare side effect called diabetic ketoacidosis
 (DKA). Only restart your Jardiamet when you are well AND eating and drinking normally.

\*\*If you have nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick) or tummy pain, you need to have a finger prick blood test immediately to check your ketone levels. This can be done at your GP clinic, after hours medical centre or hospital.

\*\*

#### Talk to your healthcare team before making any big changes to your diet

If you start eating less or go on a keto (low carbohydrate) diet or you're fasting, this may increase your risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. \*\*Talk to your healthcare team before making any big changes.

\*\*

#### Keep your genitals clean

Because you will pee more and have more glucose in your urine, you have a higher risk of getting thrush or groin infections.

Regular washing helps prevent this. Women should wash their groin and vulval area twice a day and men should wash their penis, foreskin and groin area at least once per day.

#### Prepare before an operation or a procedure

If you're going to have an operation or a procedure where you will need to stop eating for 12 hours or more (eg, a colonoscopy or dental surgery), ask your healthcare team when you should stop and restart your Jardiamet. You may need to stop your Jardiamet 3 days before the operation or procedure.

#### Fasting during Ramadan

If you are fasting during Ramadan and you're still getting enough carbohydrates, you can keep taking Jardiamet. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider about getting enough carbohydrates and drinking plenty of water while taking Jardiamet. It’s not recommended to start Jardiamet as a new medicine immediately before or during Ramadan.

#### Are you pregnant, trying for a baby or breastfeeding?

It's important to talk to your healthcare provider as soon as possible if you're trying to get pregnant, are pregnant or breastfeeding. You may need to change to another diabetes medicine.

#### Tell your healthcare team if you are taking any other medicines

Jardiamet may interact some medicines and herbal supplements, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Jardiamet and before starting any new medicines.

#### Exercising and diet

It's important to keep up your healthy diet and exercise while you're taking Jardiamet. Jardiamet works best when used in combination with good nutrition and regular exercise. It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar if you have diabetes. However, ask your healthcare provider for advice before starting a low-calorie, reduced carbohydrate or keto diet. Having too few carbohydrates in your diet while you are taking Jardiamet may increase your risk of ketoacidosis.

**Note:** You should avoid a low carbohydrate (ketogenic or keto) diet while you're taking Jardiamet as it may increase your risk of ketoacidosis.

**Marathon or long distance runners**

Being dehydrated and not eating enough carbohydrates can lead to high ketone levels, which can cause a serious but rare side effect called ketoacidosis.
If you are going to run a long distance or marathon while you are taking Jardiamet, it's important to let your healthcare provider know. You may need to stop Jardiamet the day before the marathon and restart 24 hours or so afterwards when you are well hydrated and eating normally.

#### Blood glucose testing with a glucometer

Jardiamet won't cause low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia)
unless you're also taking insulin and/or sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide or gliclazide tablets). If so, you still need to check your glucose levels with a glucometer regularly to make sure they are safe.

If you're not on insulin or sulfonylureas, you may still choose to check your glucose levels to see the effects of Jardiamet. It's also important to check your HbA1c 3 months after starting Jardiamet.

You may need a blood glucose test and a ketone test if you are unwell with vomiting (being sick) or diarrhoea (runny poo). Ask your healthcare provider for advice.

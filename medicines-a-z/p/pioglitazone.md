#### What is pioglitazone?

Pioglitazone is used to treat type 2 diabetes, together with exercise, good nutrition, weight loss and other lifestyle measures. It may be used alone or with other medicines for diabetes. It's usually used when other treatments no longer work well to control your blood glucose. Pioglitazone has other benefits such as lowering your chance of having a heart attack. Read more about [type 2 diabetes](/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2-overview/)
.

#### Dose

- In Aotearoa New Zealand pioglitazone is available as tablets (15mg, 30mg and 45mg).
- The usual starting dose is 15mg once a day.
- Depending on your blood glucose levels, your doctor may increase your dose over a few months to 45mg once a day.
- Always take your pioglitazone exactly as your doctor has told you. The pharmacy label on your medicine will tell you how much to take, how often to take it and any special instructions.

#### How to take pioglitazone

- **Timing**: Take pioglitazone once a day, at the same time each day. Swallow your tablets with a drink of water. You can take pioglitazone with or without food.
- **Avoid or limit alcohol while you are taking pioglitazone**: Alcohol may affect your blood glucose control and increase your risk of side effects.
- **Missed dose:** If you forget to take your dose, take it as soon as you remember but if it's nearly time for your next dose, just take the next dose at the right time. Don't take double the dose.
- **Keep taking pioglitazone regularly:** To control your diabetes you must take pioglitazone every day. Talk to your doctor or nurse before stopping. Contact your doctor or nurse for advice if you have been unwell and missed meals.

#### What to know while you are taking pioglitazone

Here are some things to know when you're taking pioglitazone.

- Pioglitazone can interact with some other medicines and herbal supplements, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting pioglitazone and before starting any new products.
- If you are sick and not eating, ask your healthcare provider for advice. They may recommend that you stop taking pioglitazone until you're better. Read more about [diabetes sick day plan](/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2-sick-day-plan/)
  .
- Pioglitazone can weaken your bones increasing your risk of breaking a bone, particularly if you are a woman. You may need tests to check for this before you start. If you're treated for a broken bone or fracture, let your doctor know as soon as possible afterwards.
- Pioglitazone may cause you to gain weight, this is mostly fluid. Let your doctor know if you notice fluid retention or weight gain.

#### What are the side effects of pioglitazone?

Like all medicines, pioglitazone can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Often side effects improve as your body gets used to the new medicine.

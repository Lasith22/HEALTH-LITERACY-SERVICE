#### Insulin dose and timing

Your doctor or nurse will work with you to find the best insulin to meet your needs. This can be made up of a rapid-acting insulin and an intermediate or long-acting insulin, or it can be insulin and tablets.

The timing of your insulin in relation to food and exercise is important. Your doctor or nurse will advise you when it's best to use your insulin. It's best to avoid hot showers or baths within 30 minutes of an insulin dose. Your doctor or nurse will advise what to do if you miss a dose of insulin.

#### Choosing an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue under your skin. Commonly used sites are the tummy area, thighs and buttocks – the tummy area is the preferred one. You need to move injection sites so that your skin does not become lumpy. Lumpy skin can affect how your body absorbs insulin. Also do not inject insulin on any scar tissue.

#### Drinking alcohol 

Drinking alcohol can affect blood glucose and the dose of insulin may need to be changed. Avoid or limit alcohol intake. Do not drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Eat before or while you are drinking alcohol.

#### If you are unwell and not eating 

If you are unwell, such as throwing up (vomiting) or have runny poos (diarrhoea), and not eating as you usually do, your insulin dose may need to be changed. Contact your doctor or nurse for advice.

#### How to store insulin

It is very important that insulin is stored correctly. Incorrectly stored insulin can stop it from working properly.

- Unopened insulin can be stored in the fridge until it is used.
- Do not store insulin in the freezer.
- Once opened, insulin vials, cartridges or pre-filled pens can be kept at room temperature but must be discarded after 4 weeks .
- When keeping insulin in use at room temperature, ensure it is not exposed to sunlight.

#### What are the side effects of insulin?

- **Lumpiness at the site of injection:** You may notice fatty lumps on the surface of your skin at the injection site. Change the injection site and contact your doctor or nurse if you notice pain or redness.
- **Low blood sugar:** Sometimes insulin may lower your blood sugar too much – called hypoglycaemia
  . This may cause you to feel weak, faint, dizzy, drowsy or irritable. You may get a headache, tremor (shakes) or blurred vision. If this occurs, drink something sweet such as a small glass of sweetened soft drink or fruit juice, or lollies. Make sure your family and friends know what to do too. Tell your doctor or nurse if this happens a lot. Your dose of insulin may need to be changed.

Did you know that you can report a side effect to a medicine to CARM (Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring)?  Report a side effect to a product
